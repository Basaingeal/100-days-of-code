# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked some puzzles in CodinGame. Finished the Descent Puzzle and started working in Cooders Strike Back

**Thoughts:** I think the concept of the site is fun, but I think the "code within a game" is a little awkward. Especially if you've worked with canvases at all. You don't interact with the canavs. You read input and write output, and the website interprets it through their game engine. I might pick it back up, but I think I'll be focusing on Vue and ASP.NET Core

### Day 1: January 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into Azure's AD B2C authentication system. Scaffolded a Vue app to be authenticated with it.

**Thoughts:** I've worked with auth0 as a Saas, but I'm interested in Azure's offering because I'm trying to learn how Azure does everything. I liked auth0's interface better, but I'm trying to give this method a chance. Azure just has so many different entities in general that it takes some time to understand what I'm doing. Not much code written though. Just a scaffolded app with the basic idea of being a logging app for parenting activities for newborns. (feeding, diaper changes, etc.)

### Day 2: January 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Spent time fiddling with sample projects provided by Azure B2C. Ended up switching to auth0, and adding some prereqs to the client

**Thoughts:** Again, not very much coding. At least not that's worth committing. Trying to integrate with Azure B2C has proven to be a nightmare. I'm going to switch to Auth0, because I've gotten it to work, and they serve my SPA + API needs well. I'll want to figure out how to use their library without using classes if I can help it. Would like to keep all the entities functional. I need to really try to do some actual committable code in the near future. I just feel like there's so much (non-code) set-up I want to do if I don't want to re-write everything. At least getting an authentication scheme and database set up.
