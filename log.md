# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1 , 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked some puzzles in CodinGame. Finished the Descent Puzzle and started working in Cooders Strike Back

**Thoughts:** I think the concept of the site is fun, but I think the "code within a game" is a little awkward. Especially if you've worked with canvases at all. You don't interact with the canavs. You read input and write output, and the website interprets it through their game engine. I might pick it back up, but I think I'll be focusing on Vue and ASP.NET Core

### Day 1: January 2 , 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Dove into Azure's AD B2C authentication system. Scaffolded a Vue app to be authenticated with it.

**Thoughts:** I've worked with auth0 as a Saas, but I'm interested in Azure's offering because I'm trying to learn how Azure does everything. I liked auth0's interface better, but I'm trying to give this method a chance. Azure just has so many different entities in general that it takes some time to understand what I'm doing. Not much code written though. Just a scaffolded app with the basic idea of being a logging app for parenting activities for newborns. (feeding, diaper changes, etc.)
