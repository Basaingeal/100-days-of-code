# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1 , 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked some puzzles in CodinGame. Finished the Descent Puzzle and started working in Cooders Strike Back

**Thoughts:** I think the concept of the site is fun, but I think the "code within a game" is a little awkward. Especially if you've worked with canvases at all. You don't interact with the canavs. You read input and write output, and the website interprets it through their game engine. I might pick it back up, but I think I'll be focusing on Vue and ASP.NET Core
